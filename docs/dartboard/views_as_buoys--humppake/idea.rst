==============
Views as buoys
==============


As long as there are need for only a few number of different views,
those views could be accessible using mouse, if they were presented as
buoys.

Idea of Fenfire's MindMap applitude is a good example:

 - when on 2D structure view, there would be one 2D canvas buoy for every 
   paper, where accursed node is placed

 - when on 2D canvas view, there would be one buoy with 2D structure view

Transition between views happens, of course, when a buoy is clicked.
