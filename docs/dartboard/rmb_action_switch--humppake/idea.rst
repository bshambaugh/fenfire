RightMouseButton action switch
==============================


In Sierra's SCUMM interfaces user first selected an action from a
action command list and then pointed some item for the selected
action. As the next step the actiom command list was hidden behind
right mouse button and selected action was shown as more or less
descriptive mouse cursor.

 1. user pressed RMB -> mouse cursor changed to the next action
 2. user repeats 1. until mouse cursor
    shows the correct action
 4. user points the item for action

Discussion
==========

Can we create efficiently (and how platform independently) our own
descriptive mouse cursors?

If we remain using only available default mouse cursors, what would be
a extra cue good enough with them? I.e. showing name of the selected
action in some corner?
