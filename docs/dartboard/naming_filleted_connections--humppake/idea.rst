Naming filleted connections
===========================


In RDF every connection has a property and in concept map every
connection should have a name. Normally in RDF properties are only to
help computer to interpret connection. But if we want to edit plain
RDF or use RDF to represent concept map, all properties should be shown
and editable.

As fillet technology is currently advancing fast, in filleted
connections the fillet itself could be natural place for the
connection property/name.

The property/name could also be changed by clicking the old name or
the fillet.
