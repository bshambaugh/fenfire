This PEG is currently for storing those pieces of v1 spec
that were deemed to be later. Real work on this PEG will
start once v1.0 is out.

Issues
======

Overall changes
===============

- Attach custom controllers easily

- pool control

- history path accessible

- RDF metadata for where to get pdfs which cannot be freely
  distributed

- real merging

- adjust view separation without middle button

- content links

Overall visuals
===============

Whatever is under the cursor *shall* show it somehow, e.g. main view by slightly changing color 
of irregu edges, text nodes by lightening, etc. *EVERYTHING* must do this.


Button look and feel
====================

These buttons shall have the ubiquitous 3D look, with the toggles having
the old Tk look, with a square in them that is lit or unlit based on the state
(need to distinguish between buttons and toggles somehow).

They shall react to mouseovers and mouse clicks instantly with visual feedback 
(lighting up).


Versioning / Merging
====================

Real merging
