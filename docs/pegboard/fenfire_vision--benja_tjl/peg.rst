Below, we propose a manifesto for the Fenfire project (currently
in draft form). This document shall summarize to outsiders
where we are going with this.


Notes
=====

- hyperstructure
- be as structured or unstructured as you need to be
- focus+context
- a desktop environment built around this (with a buoy view)
- applitudes interoperating seamlessly
- LEGO philosophy
- network transparency
- versioning!

The text

Various small aspects of the overall idea
=========================================

Data stability
--------------

This idea comes from Ted Nelson through xanalogical hypertext.
The point is that whatever you enter into the computer should be absolutely
permanent and stable ...

... Storm ... XXX

A single data model
-------------------

All data meaningful to a user should be stored in the same format.
This format should allow making links at any granularity.

Productization of subprojects
-----------------------------

Libvob, storm, alph &c started from fenfire as modules and at the end
started weighing so much that fenfire had to "give birth" --- separate
them into separate projects.

The new subprojects have clearly defined immediate goals in supporting
fenfire and hopefully others --- fenfire continues to be the soft research core.


Reproducibility
---------------

Any software we make should be available for anyone to 
play with. Thus, it should be free software, unencumbered
by patents or other IPR restrictions.

    The point is that for example any teenage computer enthusiast
    in a small town should be able to just get on with it.

Any hardware we require should be cheap and commonly available:
PC is OK, 3D accelerators are OK, $5000 datagloves and projectors
are not.

For example, we have experimented with building cheap controllers out of
mice and LEGOs.



Who is funding the research group and what do *they* want?
