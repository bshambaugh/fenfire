[LEGO is a trademark of someone, etc etc blah blah]

Due to the coming experiments with LEGO controllers
it would be great to choose some "flag colors" for Gzz
now and get LEGO bricks in those colors for the controllers,
avoiding the other common colors. This would enable our
designs to *automatically* be in our colors, which would
not be a bad thing ;)

Issues
======

- Should black be one of the colors for the practical reason
  of LEGO piece availability

    RESOLVED: Yes: It's also pretty stylish and fits with the 
    laptop computers.

- Why should the colors fit in with laptop computers? It's
  not like you're going to glue LEGO bricks onto your laptops,
  is it?

    RESOLVED: Yes, it is! That way, the controllers can easiest
    be connected to the laptops for use also while traveling
    or giving presentations. The weight of the laptop is
    good for stability.

- What other colors are commonly enough available as LEGO bricks?

    PARTIAL RESOLUTION: 
	
	- most common: black, blue, darkGray, gray, green,  red,
	    white, yellow
		
	- relatively common: brown, teal(cyan), orange, tan

	- relatively rare: flatSilver,  lightBlue, lime, purple



- Where can I look for data on LEGO brick availability?

    RESOLVED: The web site peeron.com lists different
    parts and their availability by year. For us, liftarms
    are probably the most important, followed by 
    gears.

- How does this PEG interact with grizzly_bear--benja?

- How many colors should there be?

    SUGGESTED RESOLUTION: 3-4. At least 2 different colors
    from the "most common" category and possibly highlight
    colors from the others.

- What might be good color combinations?

    PARTIAL RESOLUTION:

	- black, gray, white, red

	- black, gray, brown (grizzly_bear)

	- black, green, blue

	- black, white, yellow, orange

	...

- How warm colors do we want? 

- Can LEGO bricks really be obtained one by one in colors
  of your choosing?

    RESOLVED: Yes. See bricklink.com, the unofficial LEGO
    marketplace. However, prices and availabilities
    for a given piece vary by color, and because of that 
    we should try to find a relatively inexpensive 
    combination.
