I propose to adopt Emma the Grizzzzly Bear as the mascot of
the Gzz project. 


Issues
------

- How to forward email arriving at ``emma@gzz.info`` to her?

    RESOLVED: Send it to ``gzz-dev@mail.freesoftware.fsf.org``.
    The Gzz developers will take care of locating Emma and
    delivering a copy of the email to her if she's not in her den.

- Where to find an image of Emma? She does not have a
  personal home page, yet.

    RESOLVED: We'll create one for her at http://gzz.info/emma/.
