PEGs are a good format for discussing relatively finished ideas,
ready for implementation. Recent discussions with humppake and mudyc
have convinced me that we need also a freer forum which can be used
to package and label more fragmentary and unfinished ideas, to make
them easier to discuss.

Changes
=======

In addition to ``pegboard``, all subprojects will have 
a sibling ``dartboard`` subdirectory.  The ideas subdirectory will
contain subdirectories with names in a similar format to PEGs, e.g. ::
    
    type_and_connect--humppake
    elliptical_fillets--mudyc

The subdirectory should contain a main "idea.rst" file.

This is where the similarity with PEGs ends - there are no formatting
rules, no processes for accepting or rejecting ideas. The point is 
just to sketch out something and give it a label by which it can
be referred to.

If the author desires, he/she can follow the PEG conventions or ignore
them. 

Most importantly, posting to the mailing list as soon as the idea is
in a state where others can understand it is encouraged
(but not mandated).

Hand-drawn scanned sketches and images are also encouraged.

If real review of an idea, for accepting or rejecting, is desired, a PEG
referring to the idea can be made.
