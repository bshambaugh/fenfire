User-visible bugs in FenPDF 1.0
===============================

FATAL
-----

- "PLANE IS NOT A CONTAINER"!
    - gets blue screen, nothing happens
    - [mudyc] This is because someone has deleted the canvas and there 
      still are no good way to do after this operation. Until 2003-08-20 patch 
      of mouse menu this could happend. report if it still does it.

- Text texture bug is fixed by tjl:

    - Menu seems to clobber fonts?
    - Sometimes, some characters-- particular capitals, "P" and "B" are known--
      disappear. After that point, these characters will not be shown on any
      canvas until FenPDF is restarted.
    - Sometimes (usually some time after the previous bug), some characters
      will start to show as black squares, overlapping slightly onto the
      next character. Again, this will not undo itself until you restart 
      FenPDF.

- Instability. 
    - Have seen it crash in renderImpl.
    - invalid coordsys inv?
    - too many clicks -> throws an error.
   
- I got a BLACK paper from papermill?!?!?!?!

    - no, shows sometimes as a different paper, but then overwritten
      as black. What's going on with these texture ids?

    - if you zoom in or out, parts of the page may lighten up,
      so it looks like a flashlight effect illuminating part of
      a dark area

IMPORTANT:

- Backspace doesn't regenerate vob scene (or it doesn't show)
    - [mudyc] At least code does regenerate the VS.

- Text cursor often isn't exactly in the right position on x-axis;
  apparently, character widths are miscalculated somewhere
    - [mudyc] someone who has made linebreaker should fix this.

- startup takes far too long.  [slightly mitigated already 
  by tjl, fixing irregu generation.]

- [mudyc] fixed to follow the specification:

    - Clicking on a node selects it; left-dragging over a selected
      node moves that node, which makes it really difficult to
      read a piece of an article transcluded to a canvas: when
      zooming in enough that it's readable, it often fills out
      the whole irregu frame, and you cannot easily pan without
      being afraid you'll move the node...

      The solution is to follow the spec: moving nodes
      and transclusions is ``ctrl + click + drag``.

- [mudyc] Added typechecking, so fixed.
    - Typing on an PDF apparently creates a non-shown text node;
      in the RST output this'll result in something insane,
      along the lines of::

    <rdf:Description rdf:about='org.nongnu.alph.impl.PageImageScroll@ecfba14e'>
       <canvas2d:contains rdf:resource='urn:urn-5:gJ-BQIjjChv8QusiMTtiIDaYh+sC:_10'/>
    </rdf:Description>

- [mudyc] fixed
    - sometimes "not a canvas view"
    [ architecture-wise: what the hell is AbstractMainNode2D
      doing, checking members' derived types?
      We need to think about what View2D needs to do.
      getChildView2D is **NOT** a good solution.
      ]
    [mudyc] this is always seen if not a canvas view, i.e. pdf/ps.
      This can be avoid by overloading the method in fisheyeMainNode2d 
      to return null, but as tjl mentioned, something else is needed. 

- menu needs sometimes to be clicked several times

    - need proper grab framework

    - [mudyc] 2003-08-21 might be a problem that 
      AbstractUpdateManager.chg() isn't called. 
      Try to press i.e., 'ctrl' and see if this
      animates the animation. Also I think I fixed this already.
      Reports please.

- tmpimg generation and mipzip making needs to be in a separate thread

- .dsc info needs to be cached

- [mudyc] fixed
    - When creating new text node, the line cursor shown is *above*
      where text will actually be shown -- the lower end of the
      line cursor is where the upper end of the text will be.


ANNOYANCE
---------

- deleting a canvas does nothing...

- Context menu of treetime things has "Unlink buoy," which
  doesn't make sense -- remove

- timings need adjustment

- Structlink connecting not done in the right way by spec

- [mudyc] fixed partially
   - selection not removed at first other click

- no click&drag of selected area to transclude

- [mudyc] fixed
    - in pdf nodes, transclusions connected to center always,
      not real transclusion center

- in transclusion nodes, text fairly unreadable
    
    - do we need xu links!?
	- might be appropriate, or structlink with 
	  enfilade on other end?

- pdf fisheye dragging not right by coordinate system

- need way to move to same node on other focus

- multiple transclusions from a doc as a way of shortening
  doesn't work nicely with current interface - buoys need
  to be combined and buoys used several times magnified a little more

- "crosshair" cursor too large and in wrong place!

- mouse wheel scrolls too slowly
    - [mudyc] added more speed, reports please.
 
- irregu breaks with very large zoom

- selection on a PDF (for transcluding) is lost when a canvas (in the 
  other focus) is clicked *the second time*. 
  annoying when the selection/marking is first made, and then the 
  proper place for it on a canvas searched for.
  this is intended, as moving will be implemented by dragging, when
  clicking can be used for deselecting. but if multiple drags are
  needed, will this be a problem still? (perhaps not as drag!=click?)


WISHLIST
--------

- importing PDFs from URLs; a helper application/script for mozilla 
  that opens PDFs in FenPDF would be nice

- contrast / brightness adjustment for PDFs - some are much lighter than
  others.

- when importing a directory, ability to transclude first pages of all imported docs to 
  a canvas. Would make easier - did it manually with HT02, not fun.

- more than two foci, some push/pop/foo arrangement.

- cloning a focus

- flat PDF-viewing (fisheye coompletely off) and negative fisheheye
  with more magnification in the periphery (cf. book)

- when saving and later restarting, would be nice to get back to the 
  same state, i.e. same focus with same parameters (e.g. fisheye).
  a discussed solution is to have an object that can do what createMainNode
  does and gives fisheye when appropriate

ALREADY FIXED, BUT SYMPTOM OF DEEPER ARCHITECTURAL PROBLEM
----------------------------------------------------------

- unlink buoy doesn't work for transclusions!
    [ architecture-wise we should separate the bindings
      and actions as modularly as possible to help 
      people build different things out of the parts.
      Multiplexing actions by buoy type is one important thing.
      ]

BEHAVIOUR ON UNSUPPORTED PLATFORMS  
----------------------------------

- on antont@oulu.fi's workstation (tolp42.oulu.fi) fenpdfdemo crashes, 
  might well be the non-supported (currently unknown) gfx card.
  full output & glxinfo in http://an.org/fenfire/tolp42-error.txt   
  which revealed that software rendering was used (might be the cause too)
  .. does not necessarily need to be fixed, just documented when released.
